TEAM SE-OCT-GARNET (Albina Tileubergen-Thomas, Chris McAfee, "Kathryn Anderson, Reggy Tjitradi)

PHOTOGRAM instragram in a Django way

As we wrap up our time in Python, we'll finish up with one project to show off our newfound mastery (heh) of the language and all the stuff we've covered. This is to be a several-week capstone project, done in teams, where you take an existing website or service and create a reasonable (back-end heavy) clone of it.

What we're looking for is a project that can be done in a team environment with approximately three members. You will decide (as a group) the project that you want to do and you as a team will be responsible for breaking the project into manageable sections / tickets.

This project is worth 50 points, given on completion of a 10-15 minute presentation / walkthrough of the project and codebase. There will also be a Q&A portion after for instructors and other students to ask followup questions. There is also a 10 point additional bonus that is based on feedback from the peers in your group; this feedback is confidential and will not be given out.

Please make sure to read the rubric and be ready to show off items that fit the criteria.

The submission is a link to the primary repo that you were using as a team.
